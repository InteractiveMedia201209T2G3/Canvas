HEADPHONES Two Views in HTML5 Canvas


The Project is to draw Headphones using HTML5 Canvas element and display the graphic as front and side view using the function of rotating those two elements.
This is a team work project and all four of us have incorporated into the design process.
We have created the drawing on the Canvas inside the java script and drew elements inside the script.
We have added such element as rectangles and arcs for front view and circles, squares, lines for side view. Inside the side view circle we have added letter ‘B’ as a brand name of the headphones.

Once we had our basic structure for our elements we started to style it, adding colours and gradients as per graphic images designed initially in Adobe Illustrator.
